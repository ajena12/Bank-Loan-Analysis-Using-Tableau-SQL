# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Using-Tableau-SQL
This project consists of three interactive dashboards designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of a bank's loan portfolio. 
The dashboards were created using SQL for data querying and preprocessing, along with Tableau for data visualization to assist stakeholders in monitoring loan performance, trends and risk areas.
